<h2><em>Overview</em></h2>

<!--Pargaraphs-->
<p>
A cyber attack is a attack on computers systems, networks, or any internet using device. There are
multiple reasons for these attacks some of the attacks are to gain information or to use the control of
the device or network as ransom,and sometimes it is just to cause harm. They are also multiple types of
attacks such as malware, ransomware,exploit kit, and plenty of other types.
</p>

<p>
Cyber attacks can target individuals or it can be random, how it is used, its intention and targets it all
depends on the cyber criminal's intention. One of the more recent and notable cyber attacks was WannaCry.
This attack was notable because of its reach, the speed that it spread, and what most people would remember
is that it affected Britain's National Health Service, causing files to be encrypted, shutting down
hospitals and the for the individuals or individuals demanded cash to stop the attack. This hack took
advantage of two key factors, first was that hacking tools were stolen from the NSA that were able to
exploited weaknesses in Windows, the second factor was that the majority of the organizations that
were affected did not patch and were running some form of Windows 7. Cyber attacks have increase drastically
in the few years and have become more complex and have become increasingly more dangerous. Cyber attacks have
increase there attacks on public infrastructure and medical facilities worldwide using ransomware, malware
and other types of attacks.
</p>

<p>
Cyber attacks have evolved from what they were before. One way that they changed is that the cyber criminal
now have Nation-state cyber weapons, the information that the cyber criminals got allowed them to get into
iphones, Android devices, smart TVs, and most versions of Windows. There is also the fact that it has
become harder to differentiate between malware and adware, and there has been an increase in mobile adware
botnets. Cybercrimnals have also been less exclusive with their attacks, they are a attacking all geographies
with major attacks.
</p>

<P>
While cyber attacks have become more prevalent there is also been advances in security and there are means
to keep ones devices safe from attacks. Cyber security architecture that is multilayer is important, it
also needs to span across all the networks so that there is no weak point that can be breached and exploited.
There are multiple ways to keep a businesses safe from attacks some of which range from simple to complex.
One of the obvious ways is to keep up to date security patches on all systems in the business. There is
also a need constantly monitor incidents logs and alerts in order to prevent any breaches from spreading or
to enter. There is also the need to do audits and routine penetration testing to ensure that there is no
weak point that that network security is working as it should. The most important way to prevent breaches
is to educate the workers in internet safety and to reduce the privileges that they have, since viruses
usually enter from a user downloading it or having a weak password that allow cyber criminals to enter.
